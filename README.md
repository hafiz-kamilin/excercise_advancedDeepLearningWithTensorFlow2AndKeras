Compiled source code from the second edition of [Advanced Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2 and Keras](https://www.packtpub.com/product/advanced-deep-learning-with-tensorflow-2-and-keras-second-edition/9781838821654) book.

IMO, this is a really good introductory book for a widely used machine learning models. But you might need a supplementary free resources available on YouTube, Medium, or research paper to understand more on the content.

The original source code repository can be located [here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Advanced-Deep-Learning-with-Keras). But I have modified some of the code structure to suit my own convenience (i.e. code styling, eliminating spaghetti code, comments, etc).
